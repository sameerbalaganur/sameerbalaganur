# Salam, I'm Sameer! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Cloud Automation Engineer with a deep passion for DevOps and cloud technologies. My expertise includes AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform, Serverless, and Boto3. I thrive on challenging projects that allow me to delve into the intricacies of these technologies.

In my current role, I work for the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) department. Our small, dedicated two-person team handles a wide range of responsibilities, from internal automations and projects to packaged solutions and support. Despite the broad scope of our work, I particularly enjoy diving deep into the world of DevOps!! 

## About Me
- ðŸŽ“ I have a background in Tech Journalism, AWS Serverless, and DevOps.
- ðŸ’¼ Currently, I'm working as a Senior Cloud Automation Engineer at Rapyder Cloud Solutions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I possibly can, but at this point, I am getting my hands dirty with K8s, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
